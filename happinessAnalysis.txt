Kaggle happiness analysis

#1 Clean data for outliers
#2 transformations?  Log?  
look for impossible combinations?
Look for right skew of HIst; 
re-order categories such as income categories
Re-level categories as baseline
create new variables (such as NA count)
consider ignoring NA  #(probably not a good strategy here)
consider imputing new data to fill NA
# 
# Look at variables...read them
#Hypothesize some interactions

Consider the basic baseline models

table(train$happy)

#basic log and tree

Cluster analysis

prepare data -> matrix -> vector (consdier viewing leek's course)
distance(vector, euclidian
hclust  on distance

auc

k-means
How to determine k?
